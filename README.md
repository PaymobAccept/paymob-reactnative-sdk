## Installation

To get started with the `paymob-reactnative` package, follow these steps:

- **Install the Package**

  Open your terminal, navigate to your React Native project directory, and install the `paymob-reactnative` package using npm:

  ```bash
  npm install paymob-reactnative@https://github.com/PaymobAccept/paymob-reactnative-sdk.git
  ```

  If you prefer using Yarn, you can run:

  ```bash
  yarn add paymob-reactnative@https://github.com/PaymobAccept/paymob-reactnative-sdk.git
  ```

  ### iOS

- **Install CocoaPods for iOS**

  If you are developing for iOS, you will need to install CocoaPods to manage your project's dependencies. Run the following commands:

  ```bash
  cd ios && pod install && cd ..
  ```

  This step ensures that the necessary native modules are linked correctly in your iOS project.

  **Important Notice:** If you encounter an issue with the native iOS SDK, you may need to create a new blank Swift file in Xcode. After creating the blank file, be sure to click on `Create Bridging Header` when prompted.

  ### Android

- Append the following snippet to your **project-level** `build.gradle` file.
  ```java
  allprojects {
      repositories {
          maven {
              url = rootProject.projectDir.toURI().resolve("../node_modules/paymob-reactnative/android/libs")
          }
          maven {
              url = uri("https://jitpack.io")
          }
      }
  }
  ```
- Add the following snippet to your **app-level** `build.gradle` file.
  ```java
  android {
      buildFeatures { dataBinding = true }
  }
  ```

## Using Paymob

To begin using the Paymob SDK in your React Native application, start by importing the module in your component:

```javascript
import Paymob, { PaymentResult, CreditCardType } from 'paymob-reactnative';
```

### SDK Customization

You can customize the Paymob SDK to match your app's branding and user experience by calling the following functions:

```javascript
Paymob.setAppIcon(base64Image); // Set your merchant logo using a base64 encoded image
Paymob.setAppName('Paymob SDK'); // Customize merchant app name displayed in the Paymob interface
Paymob.setButtonTextColor('#FFFFFF'); // Set the text color of buttons in the SDK
Paymob.setButtonBackgroundColor('#000000'); // Set the background color of buttons in the SDK
Paymob.setShowSaveCard(true); // Enable the option for users to save their cards
Paymob.setSaveCardDefault(true); // Set saved card option as default for transactions
Paymob.setShowConfirmationPage(true); // Show confirmation page upon payment
```

These customization options allow you to tailor the Paymob SDK interface to align with your brand identity.

### Important Notice

**Please ensure that all SDK customizations are completed before calling `Paymob.presentPayVC()`. Failing to do so may result in the payment interface not reflecting your desired branding and settings.**

### Adding a Listener

To handle payment results effectively, you can add a listener that will respond to different transaction statuses. This is crucial for providing feedback to users about their payment transactions:

```javascript
Paymob.setSdkListener((status: PaymentResult) => {
  switch (status) {
    case PaymentResult.SUCCESS:
      // Handle successful payment
      break;
    case PaymentResult.FAIL:
      // Handle failed payment
      break;
    case PaymentResult.PENDING:
      // Handle pending payment status
      break;
  }
});
```

This listener will allow you to implement logic based on the result of the payment process, enhancing the user experience.

### Invoking the SDK

After configuring the SDK, you can invoke the Paymob payment interface with the following code:

```javascript
const savedBankCards = [
  {
    maskedPan: '1234', // The masked card number displayed to the user
    savedCardToken: 'CARD_TOKEN', // The token representing the saved card
    creditCard: CreditCardType.MASTERCARD, // The type of the credit card (e.g., Mastercard)
  },
];

Paymob.presentPayVC('CLIENT_SECRET', 'PUBLIC_KEY', savedBankCards);
```

**Note:** The `savedBankCards` parameter is optional. If you do not have saved bank cards to provide, you can simply call the `presentPayVC` method without it.

This function call opens the Paymob payment interface, allowing users to complete their transactions securely. Make sure to replace `'CLIENT_SECRET'` and `'PUBLIC_KEY'` with your actual credentials.
